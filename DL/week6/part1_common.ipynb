( so that outside party is one who saved markets from collapse - not geitner , bernanke , paulson ) this lack of market knowledge by all three , paulson , geitner , and bernanke , is important to understand in understanding depth of market understanding in current proposals to allow us treasury to dictate systemic risk decision , when no one at the us treasury , other than saying those words , has shown any knowledge of markets to be able to determine what that is . / s / harvey keitel , markit bon vivant jr 69.121 . 221.97 iq & markets in the iq discussion in the article it is touted that the bernanke has a higher iq and that qualified him for his job . also it has been mentioned that he is an expert in depression era events . neither worked to have bernanke act appropriately in this global crisis which he / bernanke caused via fighting the spike in oil and gold prices and his efforts directly caused this crisis . so that with bernanke\\'s higher iq did not have him perceive what he was doing would cause a near global market meltdown and his studies of the depression era did not clue him in not to cause nearly a depression . / s too true ioq ix 69.121 . 221.97 demonizing wall street for us government caused crisis in the bubble , all agree was caused by greenspan , and in the huge push to give mortgages to those non qualified which all agree was caused by fannie mae , etc and by congress , this directly lead to the subprime debacle and beginning of the global crisis - none of which was caused by wall street . then in the fight by bernanke to stop the projected inflation caused by oil & gold spikes , his actions massively slammed the overall economy which was perking along just fine even with the subprime debaclev which was a smaller part of the usa $ 15 trillion economy . next , massive jaw boning of the huge crisis was done by paulson to get funds and that caused the coup de grace , the huge retrenchment of all spending by consumers ... all these events were not caused by wall street then paulson , bernanke and later hugely obama and congress , again and again bad mouthed again and again wall street claiming that this whole series of events was caused by wall street when it was mainly caused by the us governement and aided by consumer spending retrenchment but congres and the pundits caused the us population to believe the lie it was wall street\\'s fault due to gambling . all distortion 100 % . destruction of capital formation and wall street one of the key features of bernanke\\'s job in oversight for the usa economy is in also protecting capital formation ... and the engine of economic growth in the usa for 300 years has been the usa efficient capital distribution to new ventures , old ventures , etc and the recent sequence of bad mouthing by all concerned of wall street publicly now and including esp the talking heads on cnn and esp cnbc has severely damaged that core of the reason for usa dominance and leadership for those 300 years . added to that huge destruction is the special refusal by all of the us government to identify and prosecute the huge fraudulent short selling of all major wall street firms and major usa banks which was fraudulent esp as done in a intentional and ever increasing crecend',\n",

( talk ) they may well be , but they are not sourced that way . i don\\'t think we can expect the words \" \" new anti-semitism \" \" to appear in every single report we reference . we\\'ve defined it , and we\\'ve linked to many sources who are defining it . the definition is : it is a form of judenhass that emanates from the left . it is characterized by the demonization of the world\\'s only jewish state and of jews as an ethnicity and a religion . israel\\'s right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied . the jewish people\\'s right of self-determination is denied . double standards are applied , whereby the actions of the jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her . jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the jewish state . symbols and images associated with classic anti-semitism are used : for example , blood libels are resurrected , the jewish state and jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving jews or zionists or israelis plotting to take over the world , or being in control of other governments , or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others . arab and islamic anti-semitism are excused and ignored . straw-man attacks are made , whereby jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of israel is anti-semitism , and that is then used to condemn jewish groups as unreasonable , and to deny that there is any such thing as the \" \" new anti-semitism . \" \" all of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against jews and their synagogues and schools , particularly in europe . it is found in conjunction with anti-americanism ( because jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the american government ) , anti-zionism , and the anti-globalization movement . all the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components , so when we find them , we can offer them as examples , so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-semitism or attacks on jews . ( talk ) my worry is that livingstone has not been ( at least in the sources provided ) accused of anti-semitism , and that most of the discussion of galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters . add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism ( not reporting others allegations ) , which is or ( and unwise in the case of galloway ) . the nus thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so i\\'d just want to tidy that up . livingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-semitism ( got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it ) , as has galloway , and without question his supporters . the section talks about it in relation to that election . by all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit , and we can talk later if there are any disagreements .
